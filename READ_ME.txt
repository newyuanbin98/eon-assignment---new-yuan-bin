Unity Version used:
2019.4.16f1

Everything in the project is relatively straight forward.

I added a few extra functions as I deem it to just make sense to have.
- View button function for Quiz.
(to go into quiz_details of the specific quiz)
- Delete button function for Quiz and Questions.
- Edit questions function.

I used .json file to read and write/ make the data persistent.
